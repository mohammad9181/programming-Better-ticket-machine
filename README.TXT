47. No, the balance never changes. Because I have yet to pay the right amount.
48. if we change it to greater or equel, then if the price is 10, if i insert 10 exactly, the machine will accept. When as in before, it wouldn't.

50. it was the "isVisible" feature. It was well suited because the cerle is either visible or invisible only.
51. In the naive ticket machine, "total" is the sum of all the money it has ever redeemed. Balance is the amount of money the machine currently has. 
52. Yes, the else is optional. When removed, the michine still works, it just doesn't show you anything when you print a ticket without enough balance.
53. No, because you physically have to put as much as or more than the price inorder to print the ticket. ("if (balance >= price)")
55. price * discount = saving
56. total/count = mean
59. Because all the balance is set to 0. (balance = 0;)
60. The return statement is placed on top, which means the "balance wont be able to exetute causing an error."
61. "int price" is different from the original. Although it compiles, it will always give 0, because writing it like that is like making a new local variable set to 0.
